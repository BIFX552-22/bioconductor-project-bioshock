## 1.1 Background

-   Epigenetics: The study of how your behaviors and environment can change the way your genes work.

-   Methylation: Methyl group gets added to DNA, at C/G bases. Associated with development and disease.

-   Common Methylation Research

    -   Machine learning algorithm to classify tumors.

    -   Physical activity and epigenetic markers.

## 1.2 Introduction

-   Methylation Level Measurements

    -   Two measurements for each CpG: methylated intensity(M) and unmethylated intensity(U) for determining methylation proportions 

    -   `GetBeta` function in `minfi` to get these values 

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## 2.8 DMR Analysis

-   Probe-wise differential methylation analysis is useful but does not look at entire regions.
-   The `dmrcate` package helps us identify and explore differential methylated regions (DMRs).
    -   Other functions like `dmrFind` and `bumphunter` are similar but use statistical methods and run slower.
-   Generated figure maps methlated regions against the chromosome length and known genes.
    -   Need annotated chromosome data.

## 2.9 Customizing Visualizations

-   The `Gviz` package allows for more precise customization of data visualization plots.
    -   Its package vignette is very extensive with a with a variety of different functions.
-   An important feature utilized by this workflow is to zoom in on an identified DMR.
    -   Need genomic coordinates from `dmrcate`.
    -   Need annotated chromosome data.
-   Allows for clearer presentation of results.

## 3.1 Conclusions

**Things Learned**

-   Methylation is complicated
-   Bioconductor has a vast number of packages and workflows
-   There are many tools available to visualize data

**Challenges**

-   Undoing commits with GitKraken
-   Updating R and RStudio
-   Getting the document to render
